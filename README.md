# Dynamic_Stack

This repository presents a custom dynamic stack implementation in C. Stacks, operating on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, are vital for various applications such as expression evaluation and backtracking algorithms. This implementation offers flexible resizing and key functions like push, pop, peek, and status checks. The code is well-commented and optimized for clarity and performance, serving as a valuable resource for C projects. Developers are invited to explore, contribute, and offer feedback for continual improvement.
